M1 has the fastest CPU we’ve ever made. With that kind of processing speed, MacBook Air can take on new extraordinarily intensive tasks like professional-quality editing and action-packed gaming. But the 8‑core CPU on M1 isn’t just up to 3.5x faster than the previous generation2 — it balances high-performance cores with efficiency cores that can still crush everyday jobs while using just a tenth of the power.
Up to 9x faster.14 Even for a 16‑core Neural Engine, that’s a lot to process. Apps on MacBook Air can use machine learning (ML) to automatically retouch photos like a pro, make smart tools such as magic wands and audio filters more accurate at auto‑detection, and so much more. That’s not just brain power — that’s the power of a full stack of ML technologies.
The do‑it‑all notebook gets do‑the‑unbelievable memory. The M1 chip brings up to 16GB of super-fast unified memory. This single pool of high‑bandwidth, low‑latency memory allows apps to share data between the CPU, GPU and Neural Engine efficiently — so everything you do is fast and fluid.
